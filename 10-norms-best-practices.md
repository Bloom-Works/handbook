### Tips for Success

We recognize that it takes time to settle in and absorb everything that comes along with a new job. Here are a few tried-and-true suggestions from the team to help:

* **Work Schedule:** We have team members in varying time zones and with different work schedules. We trust you to manage your time in a way that helps you fulfill your hours, get the job done, and do what you gotta do in other parts of your life. We believe you can do YOU and your work.
* **Calendars:** To help everyone schedule meetings without a lot of back and forth, share your calendar and make sure it's up to date. Calendar tip: Go to calendar settings and enter your work hours. Your calendar will display this when people try to schedule meetings with you.
* **Managing projects and priorities:** Some of us are juggling multiple projects at any given time. If you have any questions or concerns about priorities, please connect with your manager, project leads, or [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital).
* **Communication:** As a remote team, it's crucial that we share information in a timely and transparent way. We use Slack as a virtual office space to connect with others on the team. Feel free to say 'hi' or otherwise ping people there, just as you would if they were sitting at the desk next to you. We also have a number of different Slack channels to browse and join if you feel called. Here's a listing Rule of thumb: When in doubt, over-communicate.
* **Remote work life:** Working remotely can be an adjustment if you're new to it. We recommend developing practices that support managing your time, space, and well-being, like: working a generally regular schedule, making sure to take little breaks from the screen, connecting with others on the team just because, and asking other remote folks about the tricks they use to stay productive and whole. We also encourage you to meet with fellow Bloomers if you live in the same area!
* **Boundaries:** Your time is your time, but your time may not be my time. If you are messaging someone outside of their working hours, consider scheduling your message to be sent at a later time if itâ€™s not urgent. Here is how you do it in [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/201457107-Send-and-read-messages#send-or-schedule-messages) and [Google](https://support.google.com/messages/answer/10456318?hl=en#zippy=%2Cset-a-reminder-for-a-message%2Cschedule-messages).

While we can all get busy, we're always willing to try and help each other out. If you run into issues around work practices or project stuff, reach out to your manager sooner rather than later.

**We'd love to hear other bits of related wisdom from the team, so please share below if you have additional tips we can integrate here!**

<h2 id="how-we-use-slack">How we use Slack</h2>

Our central slack workspace is govbloomdigital.slack.com which you can [access by signing up for Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/govbloomdigital/signup) ðŸ”’. For an introduction to using Slack, [check out Slack's guide to getting started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members).

Please keep in mind that some Slack channels and workspaces may include our partners/clients.

For some projects, we may join teams on separate workspaces. Weâ€™ll grant you access to those on a project-by-project basis.

We follow a pretty simple channel naming convention, and if you want / need to create a new channel please reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for help. If the channel starts with:

* **bloom-:** Strictly internal and work related
* **comm-:** Committee chats, these are employee groups focused on a specific topic having to do with building Bloom culture
* **proj-:**  Current projects so team members can easily interact. We will sometimes have IC's or other business partners join these channels. These channels change often enough that they won't be listed in the intro below, but if you're on the project then one of your team members will add you to the appropriate channel.
* **social-:** Casual, get-to-know-you channels for sharing on various topics
* **proposal- or prop-:** Planned, temporary channels for the relevant team players putting together a biz dev proposal. If we win the bid then the channel is renamed with a 'proj-' prefix
* **hiring-:** Hiring (but you probably guessed that). Each role that is posted will have a corresponding Slack channel for discussion. It is archived after the position is filled.
    * **Note:** there is a general #bloom-hiring channel for logistics and hiring ideas, but individual candidates are not discussed here.
