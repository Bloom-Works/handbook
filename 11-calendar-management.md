### Setting up your Google calendar for the first time

Whether you're a maker mind or manager mind - [you'll hear this article referenced from time to time](https://medium.com/coaching-notes/maker-mind-vs-manager-mind-f4e01d294d34) - your team members rely on your calendar remaining accurate and up-to-date.

On your personal Bloom calendar, go into the settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right hand corner.

Here are a few settings we recommend updating:

* Select your default guest permissions, we suggest that you allow guests to 'modify event'
* Set your notification settings for events
* Confirm your working hours

### About working hours and location in your calendar settings

This is a useful way of establishing some boundaries in your work - by setting office hours you give everyone at Bloom a view of your expected hours in the office. For example: Sofia has her calendar set 8am - 4pm Eastern, since she is an early riser. It also sets your calendar to send Bloomers an automatic notification if they're trying to schedule you outside of office hours.

Also, if you are traveling and will be in a different timezone than usual we recommend you enable the 'working location' function which will help inform your coworkers of your time change.

### Shared Calendars

We currently have two shared Google calendars that are available for all Bloomers:

* [Bloom Calendar](mailto:govbloom.com_ano61avillvl2767i0vfjh9ccg@group.calendar.google.com) ðŸ”’ is where we document team member's Out of Office / vacation time, operations deadlines of importance, and general info that needs to be shared with the whole team.
    * Note: If you are only planning to take a partial day off, you do not need to add it to the Bloom Calendar, but please make sure it is on your personal calendar.
* [Bloom Business Development Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19rYWtmOWM0aXVqa3UxcWZwdTdzdTJtaWNhc0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) ðŸ”’ is where we track proposal timelines, BD-related events, etc.
