We're all about asking 'does this need to be a meeting or can we get what we need from an asynchronous conversation?' There are always going to be those times where sitting together on a video call can provide the best environment for productivity. With that in mind we have a few different kinds of meetings that happen regularly.

### Internal Bloom meetings

* **Bloomtime:** a once-monthly meeting where we share BD and operational updates, attendance is mandatory.
* **Project sharebacks:** these are hosted every couple of weeks as an opportunity for team members to share project updates, celebrate the close of a project, talk about new developments in our practice areas, and a wide range of other topics. Attendance is optional.
* **1:1s:** when you first join the team your manager will set up check-ins on a weekly basis. As you settle in, these meetings may drop in frequency.
* **Quarterly All Hands:** following the 2021 team offsite leadership has committed to meeting with the team on a quarterly basis to provide detailed information on the health, status and growth of the company. This meeting is mandatory.
* **Coffee/Tea Chats:** these are informal meetings we encourage you to have to get to know your coworkers better! They can be one-offs or regular (which is the best!).
* **Four month calibration meeting:** TKTK
* **Annual performance reviews:** you'll sometimes hear them referred to as 'Retrospectives.' Your manager will talk to you about this.


### Project related meetings

* Your engagement or project manager will set these up, but generally speaking they will usually host a daily 'Stand Up' so the project team can gather and discuss updates, deadlines, etc.
