Since we are a distributed team, we want to make sure that we get together IRL at least once a year! We hold our annual Bloom Offsite usually in the late summer/early fall for a chance for us to meet as a team, have some workshops, and have some social time together. 

We also encourage areas to have offsites for working sessions and social time in a smaller group.
