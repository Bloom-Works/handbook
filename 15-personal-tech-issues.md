title: Personal tech issues
---

We understand that having occasional issues with your home network, power and personal equipment are a normal part of working from home.

When you have a technical issue with your home network, power and personal equipment that stops you from being able to work at all, communicate early and often:

1. Ping your team in Slack to let them know you aren't available.
2. Set a Slack status (if you can,) so people know you aren't available.
3. If you aren't able to access Slack, deputize your work contact to let your PM(s) and team know.
4. If the problem lasts longer than 2 hours, email [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) and then log it in Harvest under Bloom Works: Timeoff, using the task "Technical Issues".
5. If it's persistent, set an out of office message.
