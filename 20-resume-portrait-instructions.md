Now that you're part of the team, we want to add you to the Bloom website! 

### How to get your photo on the Bloom Works "Team" page:

* [Check out the photos on our website](https://bloomworks.digital/team) to get a general feel for what weâ€™re serving up already.
* If you have an image that's similar in composition and vibe, yay! Fill out the form below and we will get it uploaded.
* If you need to take a new photo:
    * find a spot with generous natural light â€” preferably outside, weather permitting
    * if you can manage to capture green foliage in the background, that'll match most of the current photos â€” but it's not required
    * if you're able, position the camera so there is generous space around you in the frame â€” ideally full body or waist up at least. The more space around you, the more we have to resize and crop to match existing photos
    * for reference, our team retreat photos were taken with an iPhone 12 Pro in Portrait Mode, around noon on a mostly clear day

Slack your photo to Adam and it will be added to the website within 2 weeks.

### Bloom resume instructions

We often submit team members' resumes in our proposals, so we have a Bloom template for consistency.
