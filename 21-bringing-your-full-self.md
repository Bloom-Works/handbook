title: Bringing your full self to work
---

Bringing your full self to work means being present, engaged, and authentic in your work. It means showing up as your whole self, with all of your strengths, weaknesses, and unique perspectives. It means being willing to take risks, share your ideas, and learn from others.

There are many benefits to bringing your full self to work. When you are authentic, you are more likely to be engaged and productive. You are also more likely to build strong relationships with your colleagues and create a positive work environment.

Here are some tips for bringing your full self to work:

* **Be yourself.** Don't try to be someone you're not. We love your authenticity.
* **Be present.** When you're at work, give your full attention to your work. Don't let your mind wander to other things.
* **Be engaged.** Take an interest in your work and your colleagues. Ask questions and participate in discussions.
* **Be authentic.** Share your ideas and opinions, even if they're different from the majority.
* **Be open to feedback.** Be willing to listen to feedback and learn from it.
* **Be respectful.** Treat your colleagues with respect, even if you don't agree with them.

Bringing your full self to work is not always easy. It takes courage and vulnerability. But it's worth it. When you bring your full self to work, you're more likely to be happy, successful, and fulfilled.

### Personal appearance

As a remote company, we are pretty casual with our dress. You’ll see us in everything from t-shirts and hoodies to more business casual attire depending on the day and the event. Some people adhere to the mullet way of dressing: business on top (collared shirt, sweater), party on the bottom (sweatpants, yoga pants), but choose your own adventure! We ask that you use your best judgment when dressing for work.

### Pronouns

Being a gender-diverse team means that not everyone's pronouns are immediately obvious, so it's important to find out. Taking the time to learn and use your teammates' personal pronouns correctly will help you communicate respectfully.

Sharing your own pronouns promotes clarity and transparency. It can also promote inclusion by normalizing the practice. You can communicate your pronouns in your Slack profile, Zoom profile, email signature, Bloom bio, and in spoken communication. While this is totally optional, we encourage it!

These practices won't be familiar to everyone, and it may take some time and practice to get used to. That's ok — there are plenty of resources and people here to support you as you learn.

### Make your work from home area work for you

The good people at Dropbox has created a [Virtual First Toolkit](https://experience.dropbox.com/virtual-first-toolkit) and this part about [creating a healthy WFH experience](https://experience.dropbox.com/virtual-first-toolkit/wellbeing/work-from-home) is very good:

> Whether you’re working from a home office, bedroom, or the kitchen table, distractions are inevitable—from family members, pets, roommates, and delivery people to TV shows, podcasts, and an internet full of everything.
>
> The challenge is to create an environment that’s conducive to productivity within a space that you’ve designed for, well, living. Here are some tips for creating physical and mental boundaries that will help you stay focused:
>
> * **Make a plan.** It helps to assign yourself mini-deadlines, or plot out chunks of the day for working on specific tasks.**
> * **Communicate.** Let the people you live with know when you need quiet time and when you’ll be available again. The same goes for your coworkers. Block off both on your calendar.
> * **Limit temptations.** Sometimes facing away from something is all it takes to lessen its grip on you. It could be the TV, the fridge, or even the apps on your phone.
> * **Quiet notifications.** Everything competes for our attention these days, but not all alerts are created equal. Decide which are actually helpful—like meeting reminders—and quiet the rest.
> * **Remember your rituals.** When you punctuate every day with activities that make you feel good, it’s easier to stay focused and positive when doing work.

The entire toolkit is a great resource for everyone from WFH novices to people who have been doing this for years.
