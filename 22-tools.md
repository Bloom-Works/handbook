### Computer and equipment

Bloom is a bring-your-own-device workplace. You're responsible for getting the equipment that will help you complete your work and participate fully in our remote work environment (e.g., you'll need a webcam, microphone, maybe lighting).

We work hard to make sure the collaboration tools we use are compatible with all devices so that you can keep working with whatever system suits you best. 

Remember, [we provide a tech stipend for all salaried Bloom folks]({{ '/9-benefits-for-ftes/#tech-stipend' | url }}), so get what you need!

### Google Workspace

When you join Bloom (yay), youâ€™ll be issued a Google-based @bloomworks.digital email address. Besides being a useful communication tool, itâ€™ll also serve as your entry point to all the other tools. Youâ€™ll also get a @govbloom.com email address because not all systems recognize .digital domains. 

This will be the main address you use to more formally communicate with our partners on projects. Full-time folks will have the opportunity to choose their alias before starting.

We also use Google Calendar (for..calendaringâ€¦), Google Meet (this is mostly for folks who do not need a full Zoom license), and Google Groups for collaborative work.

### Slack

[Weâ€™ve mentioned Slack before]({{ '/10-norms-best-practices/#how-we-use-slack' | url }}), but we are nothing if not thorough and will list it here, too.

### Zoom

You can use whatever video conferencing tool is easiest for team-related calls, but we generally use Zoom for more formal calls with partners. Sometimes you will need to adjust to what a partner uses (e.g., Microsoft Teams).

In general, team members will receive free account access, so your meeting times will be limited to 40 minutes. If you think your meeting will need to run longer, you can either use Google Meet or reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) to see if a paid Zoom license is available.

### Gusto (US Salaried employees only)

This is the system we use to onboard new US based Bloomers, process payroll, and where youâ€™ll request paid time off and sick leave.

### Remote.com (Canadian employees only)

Remote.com is the Gusto of the North. 

**_Why do we use two different tools for the same function?_** At this time, Gusto doesnâ€™t support employees living internationally or those living in U.S territories (ie. Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands).

### Harvest

This is the platform we use for expenses and time tracking. In order for Bloom to stay in compliance with contracting requirements, you must log your hours on a daily basis. Please make sure to add this to your regular daily workflow. For Bloom employees who are not on projects (like people in Ops), you do not need to log your hours in Harvest, but we wonâ€™t stop you if you would like to track your time this way.

This is also where you will log any expenses you incur (travel, reimbursements, etc).

### Asana

Many project teams use Asana to track work and manage tasks. If your project team uses Asana, contact [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for an account.

### Greenhouse

Greenhouse is the hiring operating system for people-first companies. The software and structured hiring approach will help you get measurably better at hiring, so you have the technology and support you need to take on whatâ€™s next. Everyone will be able to use this to create referral links and youâ€™ll be added on if you are involved in the interview process.

We didnâ€™t choose Greenhouse because it is a place where flowers can Bloom, but that is the narrative we are willing to run with.

### Airtable

Airtable is a cloud-based platform that allows you to create custom databases and applications. It is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. Itâ€™s easy to use and can be customized to fit your specific needs. Our Business Development and People Ops teams use this tool a lot.

### Mural

We use this whiteboarding tool mainly during the discovery phases of our work, but we occasionally use it as a facilitation tool for meetings. We have a [shared Bloom account](https://app.mural.co/t/bloom5049) ðŸ”’ with limited licenses. If you need facilitator access, reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital).

### Trello

Some teams use Trello as their project management tool and we also use it to host our Bloom profiles.

Yeah, we use different tools to track, but we recognize that not one tool fits everything and want our folks to use what is best for them and their project.

### How to request new tools

If a tool that is used here turns out to be inadequate, you can request a new tool here. It will be evaluated by the [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) team and they will get back to you within 5 business days.
