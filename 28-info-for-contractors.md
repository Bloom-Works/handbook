General time tracking norms

Project-specific

### Harvest

This is the platform we use for expenses and time tracking. In order for Bloom to stay in compliance with contracting requirements, you must log your hours on a daily basis. Please make sure to add this to your regular daily workflow. For Bloom employees who are not on projects (like people in Ops), you do not need to log your hours in Harvest, but we wonâ€™t stop you if you would like to track your time this way.

This is also where you will log any expenses you incur (travel, reimbursements, etc).

##### Downloading your Google â€˜TakeOutâ€™ file


##### Shutting down your Bloom access


##### Annual 1099â€™s

It is your responsibility to ensure that Bloom Works has your most up to date contact details. You MUST reach out to us if any of your personal details change, including but not limited to: your physical address, your personal email, your entity/incorporation type (eg. SSN or EIN changes).

We are required by law to have your 1099 form postmarked no later than January 31 for the prior tax year. Our 1099 forms are generated thru our accounting software and sent out by X service. 

Hereâ€™s a rough schedule of what to expect, while youâ€™re awaiting your tax form: 

* January 01 -10 : Bloom will send an email out to the personal address we have on file to confirm that your personal details have not changed.
    * If you need to make changes, please submit a recently-dated W9 form for our records.
