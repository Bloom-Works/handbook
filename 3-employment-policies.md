### At-will notice

Your employment is At-Will. You are not hired for any definite or specified period of time even though your wages are paid regularly. You are an at-will employee of Bloom and your employment can be terminated at any time, with or without cause and with or without prior notice. Company policy requires all employees to be hired at-will and this policy cannot be changed by any oral modifications. There have been no implied or verbal agreements or promises to you that you will be discharged only under certain circumstances or after certain procedures are followed. There is no implied employment contract created by this Guidebook or any other Company document or written or verbal statement or policy.

Only authorized management may alter or modify any of the policies in this Employee Guidebook with the exception of the "At-Will Employment" provision, which cannot be altered by anybody. Nothing in this guidebook is intended to infringe upon employee rights under Section Seven (7) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).

### Equal employment

Bloom provides equal employment opportunities and administers all aspects and conditions of employment without regard to age, race, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth or medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth), gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, military status, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law. Bloom takes allegations of discrimination, intimidation, harassment and retaliation very seriously and will promptly conduct an investigation when warranted.

Equal employment opportunity includes, but is not limited to, employment, training, promotion, demotion, transfer, leaves of absence, and termination.

### Reasonable accommodations

It is the policy of Bloom to comply with all the relevant and applicable provisions of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as well as state and local laws concerning the employment of persons with disabilities. Bloom will not discriminate against any qualified employee or job applicant because of a person's physical or mental disability with respect to any terms, privileges, or conditions of employment, including but not limited to hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, and training.

Employees who become disabled should notify administration if the conditions of the disability impair their ability to perform the essential functions of their position. Where necessary and feasible, reasonable accommodations will be made for qualified disabled employees to perform the essential functions of the job in question, as long as the accommodation does not cause Bloom undue hardship.

### Exempt v. non-exempt

**Exempt:** Employees whose positions meet specific tests established by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and applicable state law and who are exempt from overtime pay requirements. The basic premise of exempt status is that the exempt employee is to work the hours required to meet his/her work responsibilities. This includes managers and assistant managers as well as designated office personnel.

**Non-exempt:** Employees whose positions do not meet FLSA and state exemption tests and who are paid a multiple of their regular rate of pay for overtime hours worked.

### Confidentiality

This paragraph is simply intended to alert employees to the need for discretion and is not intended to inhibit normal business communications. For further information, refer to the "Confidential Information and Inventions Agreement" you signed when you were hired.

### Outside activities

You may engage in outside employment or personal educational activities during non-working hours, provided that such activities do not interfere with your job performance or constitute a conflict of interest.

### Corrective action

A high level of job performance and ethical behavior is expected of you.

In the event that your job performance does not meet the standards established for your position, you should seek assistance from your manager to attain an acceptable level of performance. If you fail to respond to or fail to make positive efforts toward improvement, corrective action may ensue.

If you violate established Bloom procedures, guidelines, or exhibit behavior that violates Bloom standards of honesty and integrity or creates an appearance of impropriety, Bloom may elect to administer disciplinary action.

### Reporting irregularities

It is the responsibility of each employee of Bloom to report to a member of the management team any irregularities indicating actual or suspected existence of a loss, fraud, embezzlement or similar impairment of funds or property, or other suspicious activity.

### Conflict of interest

You know and share the values of our culture here, with an emphasis on integrity and transparency, and conflict of interest will not often be an issue, if ever. But, if you question the propriety of a transaction or activity that involves Bloom or employees/contractors of Bloom, or a client, or if an outside activity you may be considering raises questions in your mind, talk to your manager or one of the management team. 

### Background checks

As casual as we are in many areas, Bloom is a responsible, successful, for-profit business and we do apply some standard business practices. For example, we will almost certainly verify prior employment and check professional references. We may confirm your education before making you an offer. It is also possible that a security check may be required by certain clients from time to time. Third-party services may be hired to perform these checks.

### Immigration law compliance

All Bloom employees hired to work in the U.S. need to complete a Form I-9 and produce proof of identity and eligibility to work. These documents will be kept in your confidential electronic personnel file and we will need them as soon as your Employment Agreement is signed.

### Employment classifications

Bloom has established the following Employee Classifications for compensation and benefit purposes only.

**Regular Full-Time Employee:** An employee who is scheduled to work no less than 40 hours in a work week . The employee is eligible for all employment benefits offered by Bloom.

**Regular Part-Time Employee:** An employee who is scheduled to work less than 40 hours in a workweek. Regular part-time employees working at least 30 hours a week are eligible for all employment benefits offered by Bloom.

Whether an employee is exempt or non-exempt depends on specific, statutory tests. See Anti Harassment Policies. For our purposes, exempt employees don't get overtime and non-exempt do.

### Personnel (and personal) records

Bloom will maintain a secure electronic employment file while you remain an employee. This file contains things like I-9s and a copy of I-9 identification, W-4s, and Employment Agreements, and possibly other appropriate documents, on an individual basis. We use Gusto for US and Remote.com for international employees.

Any personnel changes (such as address, dependent changes, etc) can be made directly in Gusto or Remote.

### Employee references

In response to third parties inquiries, Bloom Works will only confirm employment and provide employment dates and the positions held.

### E-Verify

E-Verify is an Internet-based system that compares information entered by an employer from an employeeâ€™s Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, to records available to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration to confirm employment eligibility. [This link](https://www.e-verify.gov/sites/default/files/everify/brochures/EVerifyKnowYourRightsBrochure.pdf) will show you your rights as an employee and [this link ](https://www.e-verify.gov/employees/employee-resources)has additional employee resources.
