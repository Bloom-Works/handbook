### Documentation

Bloom complies with IRS regulations for accountable plans which require that all business expenses be substantiated with adequate records. Documentation must include:

1. The amount of the expenditure.
2. The date and place of the expenditure.
3. The business purpose of the expenditure.
4. The names of individuals other than yourself for whom the expenditures were made.


### Itemized Receipts

Itemized receipts are required for all expenditures over $50 (or equivalent in foreign currency) with the exception of mileage reimbursement and gratuities.

If no receipt exists or if the receipt is lost and cannot be reproduced, the employee may submit a copy of the credit card statement with the appropriate charge highlighted. This does not guarantee your expense will be reimbursed. In exceptional circumstances, credit card statements will be accepted as backup.


### Expense reporting and reimbursement

Expense reports should be submitted with proper receipts via Harvest within a reasonable time after the expense is incurred, generally within 30 days of business travel. Please allow four weeks for processing.
