title: Time Off
---

We all need a break sometimes and we believe in taking the time you need for yourselves and/or your families.

You do not need to justify time off, and whenever possible please try to arrange it in advance with your project team. When requesting in Gusto or Remote, please let us know it has been cleared with your manager.

### PTO and sick and wellness leave for full-time employees

* Employees who work 33+ hours per week are considered Full Time. They accrue up to 120 hours of vacation and 40 hours of sick and wellness leave each calendar year.
    * Note: Sick and wellness leave includes caretaker leave, mental health days, and bereavement. 
* Up to 80 hours (10 days) of unused vacation can be carried over per calendar year. These unused, accrued vacation days DO NOT aggregate year-on-year.
* Bloom also offers an additional 80 hours (10 days) of Floating Holiday time to be used at the employee's discretion.
* The office is closed collectively between December 24th through January 1st and is considered holiday time outside of the Floating Holidays. If January 1st falls on a weekend, the first weekday following it is deemed a work holiday.
* If, for any reason, you are unable to work the expected hours on your project for reasons other than PTO (if for example your project team or role on the project is blocked) speak with your manager and they will help determine the right next steps.
* We are not ones to tell you how to use your time, but we recommend that you use your floating holidays first.

### PTO and sick and wellness leave for part-time employees

* Employees who work 32 or fewer hours per week will accrue a prorated amount of vacation and floating holiday time.
* Employees are still entitled to 80 hours (10 days) of sick and wellness leave.
    * Note: Sick and wellness leave includes caretaker leave, mental health days, and bereavement. 
* The unused carry over rate of unused PTO and sick time will be determined upon hire, depending on the number of expected work hours.

### Floating holidays

When you start at Bloom as a full-time employee, you immediately get 10 floating holidays to use at your discretion. These days do not count against your paid time off.

We opted for this instead of a regular holiday calendar because we have a diverse group of people who work here and we wanted to empower you to choose the days that mean the most to you.


### Jury Duty

To provide income protection while an employee carries out his or her civic responsibility, Bloom Works provides the difference between jury duty pay and an employee’s regular day’s pay for time spent serving on jury duty. Generally, income protection for time spent serving on jury duty will be provided for a maximum of five workdays. Additional income-protected time away from the workplace for this purpose will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

#### Eligibility

Full-time and regular, part-time employees are eligible to receive this benefit.


#### Responsibility

Upon receipt of notification from the state or federal courts of an obligation to serve on a jury or to act as a court witness, notify your project lead. You are required to provide copies of the subpoena or jury summons to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for recordkeeping purposes.

If you are appearing in your own case as a plaintiff or defendant or for a non subpoenaed court appearance will not receive paid time off. Vacation or unpaid time should be used for such instances.

### Paternal Leave

Welcoming a new child is an amazing time for a family and we want to support employees during this time to take the time to bond with their new child (by birth or adoption, or placement in foster care if the child is under the age of 18, or incapable of self-care because of a physical or mental disability) and acclimate to the new life ahead. Our policy is that expectant parents can take eight weeks of leave fully paid after 9 months of employment. If an employee has been at the company for less than 9 months or if for any reason the expectant parent needs additional leave, we will review requests on a case-by-case basis. All Parental Leave described in this Policy shall be available for a 12-month period following the birth or adoption of a child.

For birthing parents there is also the option to use short-term disability for additional paid leave time. Please contact [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for more information on this benefit.

### Bereavement

We understand that the death of a loved one is a difficult and emotional time, and we want to do everything we can to support our employees during this time. You are able to use your sick and wellness leave for bereavement. If you need any additional accommodations, reach out to your manager.

### Personal Leave of Absence

Employees of Bloom Works, including part-time employees, who have worked for at least one year may request a personal leave of absence. A leave of absence is for extended periods, typically four weeks or more, where an employee is fully or part-time away from work, for example taking courses/training, handling extended personal matters, completing a personal project, or world travel. Leaves will be discussed on a case by case basis and may be paid, partially paid or unpaid.

### Relocations

### Temporary relocations within the continental US and Canada

We get it. Sometimes we all want to leave home and work from an A-Frame in the woods. If you are temporary relocating to another state, TK


### Temporary relocations outside of the continental US and Canada

Temporary relocations are okay as long as you are not staying away from your home of record long enough to establish residency, our project allows you to work, and it has been cleared with your lead. In most instances, this is 183 days (or 6.016 months if we are being pedantic about it), but it is up to you to check.

Here is what you need to do before committing to that nomadic life:

1. See if your project allows for working outside of the United States. 
2. Reach out to your project lead for permission and create  a plan that will make working sustainable while you are abroad.
3. Reach out to your practice area Directors for awareness.
    1. This will allow them to plan ahead if there are new projects on the horizon.
4. Check in with People Ops to make them aware of your situation.
5. Send Dottie treats from your temp location (not really, but a girl can dream).
