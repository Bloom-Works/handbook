We hire good people and support them with the best benefits possible, which will only get better and better as our business grows:

* An environment that empowers you to unleash your superpowers for public good
* Distributed-first work environment with empowerment to set reasonable hours
* Medical: 90% of premium and up to 50% for dependents
* Dental & vision: employee 99% and 50% for dependents
* Life insurance: $50,000 
* FSA: Up to $250 annual matching contribution from Bloom 
* [PTO: 15 days ](#TK)
* Floating holiday: 8 days
* Sick and wellness days: 10 sick
* Our office is also closed for the winter holiday (12/25-1/1)
* Equipment / ‘office improvements’: $1,000 stipend to use during your first year
* Professional Development: $2,000 annual allowance (some limitations apply)
* ST/LT disability
* Retirement savings (401k) through Guideline: (100% match up to 6% match)

The benefit amounts above are for Full Time equivalent employees. Part Time employees will receive a prorated portion of the same benefits.

This benefit includes caretaker leave, bereavement, mental health days, and sick days.

### Pay frequency

Bloom Works is on a bi-monthly payroll cycle, meaning that payroll is processed every two weeks (roughly on the 15th and final day of each month). If payroll dates fall on a weekend or a holiday then paychecks will be processed on the earlier business day. 

We use Gusto to administer payroll and benefits. Gusto sends all payments via direct deposit and  you can access your detailed pay stubs online. 

### 401k/Retirement

Guideline, our 401k admin, will reach out to you directly to set up your account. Our Plan automatically enrolls you for the maximum matched withholding amount (6%) - **you must log in prior to your first payroll to make any necessary adjustments**.

There is no vesting period — all of our employees are automatically 100% vested from the start. 

### Healthcare

The only potential waiting period has to do with the date that you join the team, since our health plans only take on new members at the start of a calendar month. For example, if you start on June 15 then your first date of coverage would be July 1.

Vision, Dental and Long Term and Short Term disability are provided by [Guardian](https://www.guardiandirect.com/). Our Medical plan options are all through [UnitedHealthcare](https://www.uhc.com/). Detailed plan descriptions and cost estimates can be shared upon request. 

If you have any additional questions regarding benefits, please contact [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital).

<h3 id="tech-stipend">Tech Stipend</h3>

As part of Bloom’s commitment to work/life balance and our movement toward greater workplace equity, it is aligned with our values to provide "Technology Stipends" to our employees to reimburse them for necessary expenditures including reasonable costs that are common for all employees at Bloom. You will be able to expense $1,000 in your first year for items that will make your home work environment effective, efficient, and a place you enjoy logging in. We are pretty flexible about what can be expensed, but this does not include things like monthly internet (your employees probably already have that), coffee to drink at home, or other aesthetic touches (sadly, bounce houses are not justifiable expenses. I TRIED!)

Since the tech stipend is a reimbursement of expenses it is not subject to income tax in the United States. 

### Professional Development

Bloom recognizes the importance of professional development opportunities for all team members, and we encourage you to take advantage of this Bloom benefit. We value Professional Development for a number of reasons:

* It's a win-win! Professional development grows the depth and value of the company offerings and enhances your career opportunities, too.
* Professional development provides career mobility for each person - increasing our feeling of safety, which leads to:
* Having the courage to fail, which leads to experimentation, innovation, and learning
* Having the courage to challenge the status quo, which leads to organizational learning
* Having the courage to be vulnerable, which leads to authentic communications and connection
* Open-minded thinking, which leads to increased tolerance of others' ideas and personality styles \


Bloom Works supports and encourages the Professional Development (Pro Dev) of each team member by providing an annual budget of $2,000 per person to be used for Pro Dev-related expenses. Note: If you are a part-time employee or under 30 hours/week, your budget will be prorated based on your working hours.

In addition to the annual budget, each team member is encouraged to use a "take what you need" approach to using time for Pro Dev pursuits during business hours, within the bounds of any billable hours goals you may have. If you need guidance on what amount of time is appropriate to spend on Pro Dev in a given year, consult with your manager.


#### Your Pro Dev Budget

Each full-time team member is provided an annual Pro Dev budget of $2,000. If you're just starting, you'll need to wait 90 days before you gain access to your Pro Dev budget. If you're a part-time employee or under 32 hours/week, your budget will be prorated based on your working hours.

This budget can be used a number of things:



* Online or in-person courses
* Testing fees & renewal costs associated with professional certifications
* Other costs incurred from you becoming a smarter, more awesomer version of you \

There are some limitations on the Pro Dev budget usage. For spending amounts over $50, you'll need to get approval in advance. And unfortunately under the benefit plan we've chosen for this program we are not able to directly reimburse things like travel costs or for supplies that you can retain after completing your courses/tests/certifications. If you have specific questions about limitations, reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital).

For Pro Dev expenses we ask that you put together a justification or explanation as to why this expense is relevant to your role and development. A paragraph or two should be more than enough to address this. When you're ready to move forward please email the request and explanation to admin@bloomworks.digital.

Remember that your budget does NOT carry over at the end of the year. So get busy learning something! Use it or lose it.

Want to spend more money than I have budget for? Talk to your manager if you have Pro Dev needs that can't be covered by your annual budget.

#### Making a Plan

While this isn't a required practice, you are still encouraged to take responsibility for your own professional development by creating a Pro Dev plan and setting goals for yourself. This also helps in getting your Pro Dev expenses approved in a timely manner.

#### Asking a Mentor, Coach, or Peer to Help

For some people, getting input from others is an important part of the professional development process. You are encouraged to seek out other Bloomers who you think could help you achieve your Pro Dev goals. This may be a manager, a peer, or any person who is good at something you'd like to learn. You may even wish to seek expertise outside of Bloom Works to help.

If you're asked by someone else to assist with their Pro Dev, please make time to help them out!
