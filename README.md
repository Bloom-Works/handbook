# handbook
The Bloom Works employee handbook, with our policies and norms.

## How we're using this repo
We're using [issues organized in this project]([url](https://github.com/orgs/bloom-works/projects/7)) to manage updates to the handbook. These updates include technical updates to the guide as well as content to create, update, or migrate. 

## How we priortize updates
We will prioritize content to create/update/publish thatâ€¦
- Is required for legal or regulatory compliance
- Addresses frequently asked questions or needs that Bloomers have expressed

Definitions of priorities (we are using labels for these):
- **priority-1** = High priority to create/update. Required for legal/regulatory compliance, AND necessary for new staff onboarding, AND addresses critical needs/questions from Bloomers
- **priority-2** = Med priority to create/update. Required for legal/regulatory compliance, OR necessary for new staff onboarding, OR addresses critical needs/questions from Bloomers
- **priority-3** =  Low priority to create/update. Not required for compliance, not necessary for new staff onboarding, but addresses non-urgent needs/questions from Bloomers
