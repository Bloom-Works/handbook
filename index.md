![A super weird AI generated utensil that shouldn't exist](/img/weird_utensil.png)

This handbook is the source of truth about working at Bloom. It’s for Bloomers new and old to understand policies, norms, and other expectations throughout your time with Bloom. We make much of it open so potential employees can see what Bloom is like, but some links go to internal documents that are either sensitive or in-progress.

The goal of this resource is to support Bloomers and contractors so you can thrive professionally. Your success is critical to fulfilling our mission and providing great services to our clients.

We ask you to read this guide in full when you join Bloom. We also hope you’ll return to it when you have questions or need to reference specific policies or processes.

For Bloom employees, once you’ve read this, please go to 🇺🇸Gusto or 🇨🇦Remote to sign acknowledgements of the policies in this handbook.

## How to contribute

We invite contributions, whether you have a question ( “How do I do ABC?”), want to make a comment or suggestion (“Make it clearer how to do ABC”), or want to contribute changes (“Here’s draft language on how to do ABC”).

* **Ask a question**: Hop into #bloom-handbook, or talk with your manager about questions that are more individual or sensitive.
* **Suggest an update**: Submit an issue to the GitHub repo using the [‘Comment or suggestion’ issue template](https://github.com/bloom-works/handbook/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=comment-or-suggestion.md&title=). If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, drop your comment in #bloom-handbook, and be sure to include context that will help us prioritize and take action:
    * What do you want to be able to do or understand?
    * If there's something missing or confusing about the handbook, how is this impacting you (or might impact you in the future)?
    * Use a user story format to put this suggestion in context, ex: As a [USER OR ROLE], I want [SOMETHING, OR TO DO SOMETHING], because/so that [WHY].
    * Other notes, context, concerns, or topics that would be helpful for the handbook team to take action on this.
* **Contribute updates**: [Open a pull request](https://github.com/bloom-works/handbook/pulls).
