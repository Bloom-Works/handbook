This handbook is the source of truth for all things Bloom Works and is a resource for you to use throughout your tenure at Bloom. We also use it to inform candidates and those who want to work with us of our practices and policies as we want to be transparent, but with discretion. 

We also want you to know that our policies reflect our values. We want them to be thorough and thoughtful.

# Welp, here's an update. 

Take some time to read this guide and let us know if you have any questions.
