We want Bloom to be a safe, welcoming, and inclusive culture. Everyone at Bloom should be able to do their best work in an environment that is respectful and kind. We also want our team and workplace culture to reflect and celebrate the diversity of the communities we serve.

This Code of Conduct summarizes anti-harassment law and Bloom policy. We use plain language whenever possible to promote a culture of inclusion and respect.

We expect all Bloom employees and contractors to exhibit these behaviors and abide by applicable federal, state/provincial, and local laws.

# What we expect and why
We strive to create an open, inclusive, and thoughtful culture that empowers people to provide outstanding service for our partners, clients, and members of the public who use what we build. It would be impossible to list everything staff can do to create a welcoming space, and we know this team will find ways to include their colleagues that we haven't even thought of. When in doubt, we encourage you to look to these principles for guidance:
- Practice empathy. Try to treat others how they would like to be treated.
- Bring care and curiosity about others’ experiences and how your actions impact them.
- Be respectful of different opinions and viewpoints. Share your ideas and opinions, even if they're different from the majority. Our work depends on divergent as well as convergent thinking.
- Give and accept constructive feedback with generosity.
- When you make mistakes or find that your actions have affected someone negatively, accept responsibility and make amends. When you know better, do better.
- Ask questions and listen carefully and actively.
- Assume competence in your colleagues, clients, and the public.
- Bring humility about the limitations of your own experience and perspective.
- Treat others’ identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people's names correctly and refer to them by their stated pronouns.

We have a variety of communication tools and forums, including Slack, Zoom, Google Meet, and in-person events, and our code of conduct applies in all of them.

We encourage everyone at Bloom to help uphold our expectations for inclusive, welcoming, and professional behavior. If someone makes a mistake or misspeaks, tell them clearly, kindly, and directly. Follow appropriate escalation paths to work towards resolving conflicts or issues constructively. If you need support in giving feedback to a coworker, talk to your manager.
## Unacceptable behavior
We do not tolerate unwelcome verbal, written, visual, or physical conduct based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, parental status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, national orientation, age, disability, genetic information, veteran status, military status, or ethnicity. This is called harassment (including sexual harassment), and it is both illegal and against Bloom policy. Discrimination is also illegal and undermines Bloom’s mission, values, and work.

The following behaviors violate Bloom policy and undermine our culture of respect, regardless of whether they rise to the legal definition of harassment:
- Touching people without their affirmative consent
- Sustained disruption of meetings, talks, or discussions, including online
- Mocking someone’s real or perceived accent or first language
- Repeatedly interrupting or talking over other people in meetings
- Negative or offensive remarks based on gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, or body size
