Bloom is a bring-your-own-device workplace. You're responsible for getting any equipment that will help you complete your work and participate fully in our remote work environment (like a webcam, microphone, or even lighting). 

Some projects issue government furnished equipment (GFE), but youâ€™ll still need your own device for Bloom-related work.

We use collaboration tools that are compatible with all devices so you can keep working with whatever system suits you best. 

Remember,  we provide a [remote work stipend for all salaried Bloom folks](/sections/pay-and-benefits/#remote-work-stipend), so get what you need! 

If you want or have equipment recommendations, [Bloomers are populating this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pf4L1FK83dumIw3u9i-YEhmYBuAoM-TOFsDcYMuUl6E/edit) to help you out.
