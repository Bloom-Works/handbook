title: Expenses and reimbursement procedures
---

When you have reimbursable expenses (like travel costs, professional development, or equipment covered by your remote work stipend), submit them via Harvest within 30 days. (In some cases, doing it sooner will help us process them much faster, especially near the end of the month.) It can take up to four weeks to process expenses and issue reimbursements. 

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦Canadian employees will also need to log expenses in Remote. When adding into Harvest, convert CAD amounts to USD based on [that day's Bank of Canada exchange rate](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange/daily-exchange-rates-lookup/) or your financial institution's exchange rate.

If youâ€™re expecting a business expense and are uncomfortable waiting for reimbursement, let People Ops know and theyâ€™ll work with you to find another solution.


# Approval

In general, expenses shouldnâ€™t be a surprise to your manager or People Ops. You need advance approval (via email) for:

* [Professional development](INTERNAL LINK TK) spending (from your manager)
*[Travel](INTERNAL LINK TK) (from your Engagement Manager and/or manager)
* Gifts (from People Ops)

You donâ€™t need advance approval from your manager to spend your[remote work stipend](INTERNAL LINK TK), but if youâ€™re not sure itâ€™s an eligible expense, check with People Ops before you spend the money. If we canâ€™t approve the expense, we may not reimburse you.


# Documentation

Itemized receipts are required for all expenditures over USD $50 (or equivalent in foreign currency) with the exception of mileage reimbursement, daily meals & incidentals, and gratuities.

Bloom complies with IRS regulations for [accountable plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountableplan.asp#:~:text=According%20to%20IRS%20rules%2C%20under,company%20within%20a%20specified%20timeframe.)  (this is the legal tax thing that lets the IRS differentiate reimbursement from income so you donâ€™t get taxed on reimbursements) which require that all business expenses be substantiated with adequate records. Documentation must include:

1. The amount of the expenditure.
1. The date and place of the expenditure.
1. The business purpose of the expenditure.
1. The names of individuals other than yourself for whom the expenditures were made.

If thereâ€™s no receipt, or if the receipt is lost and cannot be reproduced, you may submit a copy of the credit card statement with the appropriate charge highlighted. This does not guarantee your expense will be reimbursed.
