## Personal appearance

You’ll often see coworkers in t-shirts and hoodies, especially for internal meetings. Some adhere to the “[mullet](https://www.fayobserver.com/story/news/regional/2023/07/24/north-carolinas-brantley-kirwin-makes-top-100-in-mullet-contest/70443829007/)” approach: business on top (collared shirt, sweater), party on the bottom (sweatpants, yoga pants).

In client or business development meetings, we try to match our client’s vibe — or at least meet them halfway by looking tidy and professional. If you’re not sure how dressy to be, get a second opinion from your engagement manager.

We default to cameras on for most meetings, but people often go off camera to eat, move, or just because they’re having a bad hair day  (you’re not, by the way... we like what you're doing with it!).


## Your work from home setup

We expect that everyone at Bloom will have a functional, quiet workspace that supports focus for you and the people you’re meeting with  (which is why we have a **INTERNAL LINK TK** [remote work stipend](#heading=h.po2w7dxbjir) to help you get set up). 

For client meetings, make sure your background is neat or consider using a virtual background. If your space is temporarily noisy, use headphones and use mute to reduce the impact on your meetings.

Working remotely can be an adjustment if you're new to it. We recommend developing practices that support managing your time, space, and well-being, like: working a generally regular schedule, taking little breaks from the screen, connecting with others on the team just because, and asking other remote folks about the tricks they use to stay productive and whole. 

We also encourage you to meet in person with fellow Bloomers if you live in the same area (look for or create a #social-&lt;locality> channel).

The good people at Dropbox have created a [Virtual First Toolkit](https://experience.dropbox.com/virtual-first-toolkit), which is a great resource for everyone — from WFH novices to people who have been doing this for years. We especially like the section on [creating a healthy WFH experience](https://experience.dropbox.com/virtual-first-toolkit/wellbeing/work-from-home).

If your home network, power, or personal equipment malfunction, **INTERNAL LINK TK** [follow our guidance for unplanned time off](#heading=h.2a491hyurgfd) to let your team know as soon as you’re safe and able.
