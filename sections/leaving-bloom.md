title: Leaving Bloom
---

We would like Bloom to be a place where open dialogue can surface mismatched expectations, and both employees and management can seek to address issues together. We hope to make Bloom the best option for you, but in cases where we canâ€™t we want to create an amicable transition for you, for your coworkers, and for our future selves whenever our paths cross again.


# Resignation

Please provide a minimum of 2 weeks written notice of your intent to leave Bloom to your manager. 

We may ask you for an exit interview to learn more about your experience and why youâ€™re leaving. Your feedback can help us improve our culture, policies, and practices.


# Termination

If there is a problem with an employee's performance or conduct, or there is otherwise clearly a bad fit between the employee and Bloom, we'll make every [effort to remedy the issue](INTERNAL LINK TK). If termination turns out to be the only solution, the employee will be fully aware of, and probably in agreement with, the reasons.


# Returning property

Any company or government property issued to employees, such as documents, computer equipment, or company credit cards, must be returned to Bloom at the time of separation.


# Terms upon employee departure

When you leave Bloom, you will be paid out unused accrued personal time. Respite leave and floating holidays will be forfeited.

**ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**Every state has different laws regarding your last paycheck. This [Gusto article](https://support.gusto.com/article/110807134100000/Dismiss-and-rehire-employees) ðŸ”’would be the best resource to find out what you need.


# Archiving your user accounts

If you resign from Bloom, we ask you to do some housekeeping on your way out. A few days before your last day, start the archiving process for Bloom software products. [Hereâ€™s a checklist to walk you through that process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-98LWKCu-lPevNYzjcdm7lw4-2tV6uBeIoronsTj9ro/edit?usp=sharing).
