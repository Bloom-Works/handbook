## Internal Bloom meetings

During your first few weeks, you’ll start to see meetings appear on your calendar. Here are some of the internal Bloom meetings you can expect:

* **Bloomtime:** These are regular meetings where we share operational updates, Q&As, or training. Attendance is optional unless indicated otherwise.
* **Project share outs:** These are hosted every couple of weeks as an opportunity for team members to share project updates, celebrate the close of a project, talk about new developments in our practice areas, and a wide range of other topics. Attendance is optional.
* **1:1s:** When you first join the team, your manager will set up check-ins on a weekly basis. As you settle in, these meetings may drop in frequency.
* **Quarterly All Hands:** Leadership will provide detailed information on the health, status and growth of Bloom. This meeting is mandatory.
* **Coffee/Tea Chats:** These are informal meetings we encourage you to have to get to know your coworkers better! They can be one-offs or regular.

All Bloom-wide meetings occur during our core hours (12 pm - 4:30 pm ET), and most are on Thursdays between 3-4 ET/12-1 PT. If anyone schedules a meeting outside your working hours, let them know — it’s usually a mistake, because time zones are hard.

## Project meetings

Once you’re assigned to a project, you’ll also settle into a cadence of check-ins, planning meetings, and client meetings. Every project has a different rhythm, so your manager can tell you more about what to expect.

## Offsites

As a distributed team, we make sure to get together in “real life” at least once a year! We hold our annual Bloom Offsite in the late summer or early fall for a chance to meet as a team, hold some workshops, and have some social time together. 

Occasionally, teams also have smaller offsites to collaborate or get to know each other.
