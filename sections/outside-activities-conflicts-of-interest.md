title: Outside activities and conflicts of interest
---

You may engage in outside employment, personal educational activities, and serve on boards during non-work hours, provided that they don’t interfere with job performance or create a conflict of interest. 

Let your manager know if you're considering freelance work that overlaps with what you do at Bloom. Work shouldn't depend on or conflict with your experience at Bloom (like freelancing for an existing Bloom client), and should not present a potential conflict of interest (such as freelancing at an org that Bloom is pursuing work with, partnering with, or might compete against).

If you are a salaried Bloom employee considering “moonlighting” for another organization in public interest technology, or starting your own enterprise, talk to your manager before you make plans. It may be fine, but we don’t want to be surprised.


# Conflict of interest

We want to avoid both personal and professional conflicts of interest. These conflicts could potentially have negative effects on Bloom which could hurt our reputation, our finances, or could be against the law.

Situations that raise this possibility include:

* Familial or romantic relationships with clients, subcontractors, or other people within organizations that Bloom does business with.
* Familial or romantic relationships with coworkers who supervise, report to, or otherwise control each others’ work.
* “Moonlighting” or freelancing outside of your Bloom employment with organizations that Bloom does business with, competes with, or may do business with or compete with in the future.

If you find yourself with a potential conflict, reach out to your manager to discuss as soon as possible.
