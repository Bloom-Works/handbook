## Set defaults and working hours in Google Calendar

On your personal Bloom calendar, go into the settings by clicking the gear icon in the upper right hand corner. Here are a few settings we recommend updating:

* Set your notification settings for events
* Set a default meeting duration (our norm is 30 minutes, but some folks choose 25)
* Confirm your working hours
* Add a secondary time zone to your calendar, so you can see where meetings will land for those across the country (settings > time zone > display secondary time zone)

## Set your email signature

Hereâ€™s a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaK-lQacImYNa-fyfDrY5iIvU5X7gSm1bq0ilfa1tBI/edit?usp=sharing) ðŸ”’to use. Note that we spell out our websiteâ€™s URL to reinforce that we are a .digital and not a .com.

## Install the Bloom default styles in Google Docs

This is especially important if you'll be creating any business development or client-facing Bloom documents. Go to the **[Visual Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k5lB6L2Uaiaomw6QZqqNWdDUad_IDbMEEEceI9Cd0Gg/edit#heading=h.g5pyyoerqoo3) ðŸ”’** in Google Docs, then click on the 'style' drop down and set your default styles. The screenshot below shows you exactly how to turn on this default:

## Create a Bloom resume 

We often submit team members' resumes in our proposals, so we have a Bloom template for consistency.

1. [Check out the resume template on Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xkY1BekVOIgimT_idKyhStqg5fJ56GHRmZiMW0dZV0g/edit) ðŸ”’
2. Create a copy and move it to [Bloom Full Team Drive > Team > Bios, photos, resumes folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1wqWI38uNF0l8XbqhPGGLFDN-m26A4s60). ðŸ”’


## Get added to the Bloom website

Now that you're part of the team, we want to add you to the Bloom website! 

* [Check out the photos on our website](https://bloomworks.digital/team) to get a general feel for what weâ€™re serving up already.
* If you have an image that's similar in composition and vibe, yay! Fill out the form below and we will get it uploaded.
* If you need to take a new photo:
    * Find a spot with generous natural light â€” preferably outside, weather permitting.
    * If you can manage to capture green foliage in the background, that'll match most of the current photos â€” but it's not required.
    * If you're able, position the camera so there is generous space around you in the frame â€” ideally full body or waist up at least. The more space around you, the more we can resize and crop to match existing photos.
    * For reference, we took our team retreat photos with an iPhone 12 Pro in Portrait Mode, around noon on a mostly clear day.

Slack your photo to @adam and weâ€™ll add it to the website within 2 weeks.


## Set up your profiles with your name, pictures, and pronouns

Sharing your pronouns helps people refer to you correctly, and can promote inclusion by normalizing the practice. Include your pronouns in your Slack profile, Zoom profile, email signature, Bloom bio, and in spoken introductions.

Add a picture and your chosen or preferred name/nickname to each tool to help your coworkers recognize you and address you in the way you choose.


## Get to know your coworkers

This [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/WVHYQUIn/bloom-overview) ðŸ”’ is a good place to learn about fellow team members and has links to some basic information. Add your own card so people can learn about you, too!


## Setup GitHub account

If you have a GitHub account already, post your GitHub user ID in Slack's #bloom-tech-ops channel  and we'll add you to our GitHub Org.

If you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one on [their signup page](https://github.com/signup).

Our GitHub org requires two-factor authentication and all of GitHub will require it by the end of 2023. See [instructions on how to add 2FA to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication).
