We’re a consulting company, which means we bill for our time, selling our expertise and methodology to clients.

We use [Harvest](https://govbloom.harvestapp.com/) to record what we spend time on. Here’s what that means:

* We ask you to submit timesheets weekly so we can consistently monitor projects and keep budgets on track. All timesheets for the month must be completed by 12pm ET on the first working day of the next month so we can invoice our clients, even if the end of the month falls in the middle of the week.
* We track time in 15-minute increments (though often whole hours are plenty, since many people are full-time on one project). No need to subtract 2 minutes every time you take a sip of water!
* If you’re full-time on a project, we expect you to bill 36-40 hours/week depending on the project. If you’re part-time on a project, your manager will tell you how many hours you’re expected to bill for each project.
* When you start a new project, talk to your engagement manager and manager about norms and expectations for tracking time.

Note that Bloom employees who are not on projects (like people in Ops) do not need to log hours in Harvest.

If you can’t work the expected hours on your project for reasons other than leave (like if you don’t have enough work or your role on the project is blocked), speak with your manager and they’ll help determine the right next steps.

If your workload will require you to work more than 40 hours per week, flag it for your manager as soon as possible. We don’t compensate employees for overtime — but we do have strong norms around work-life balance and want to make sure you can limit your workload to 40 hours per week.
