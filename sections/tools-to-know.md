We try to use tools that work with any operating system. This gives Bloomers the ability to use Mac, Windows, Linux, or whatever OS your little heart desires. 

If you need support on any of these tools, pop into the **#bloom-tech-ops** channel in Slack and ask questions there.

## Bloom-wide tools

**Google Workspace**

Weâ€™ll issue you a Google-based @bloomworks.digital email address, which serves as your entry point to all the other tools. This is the main address youâ€™ll use to communicate with folks outside of Bloom, and for more formal Bloom messages. 

We also use Google Calendar, Google Meet (as an alternative to Zoom), and Google Groups (for managing permissions and comms). Youâ€™ll also get a @govbloom.com email address because not all systems recognize .digital domains.

We currently have two shared Google calendars that are available for all Bloomers:

* [Bloom Calendar](mailto:govbloom.com_ano61avillvl2767i0vfjh9ccg@group.calendar.google.com) ðŸ”’ is where we document Out of Office time, operations deadlines of importance, and general info that needs to be shared with the whole team.
* [Bloom Business Development Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19rYWtmOWM0aXVqa3UxcWZwdTdzdTJtaWNhc0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) ðŸ”’ is where we track proposal timelines, BD-related events, etc.

**Slack**

We use Slack as a virtual office space to connect with coworkers. Feel free to say 'hi' or otherwise ping people there, just as you would if they were sitting at the desk next to you.

Our rule of thumb: when in doubt, over-communicate.

Our central Slack workspace is **govbloomdigital.slack.com**. For an introduction to using Slack, [check out Slack's guide to getting started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members) ðŸ”’.

For some projects, we may join teams on separate Slack workspaces. Weâ€™ll grant you access to those on a project-by-project basis. Keep in mind that some Slack channels and workspaces may include our partners and clients.

We follow a pretty simple channel naming convention. If the channel starts with:  

* **bloom-:** Strictly internal and work related.  
* **comm-:** Committee chats. These are groups focused on a specific topic to build Bloom culture.
* ** proj-:**  Current projects so team members can easily interact. IC's or other business partners sometimes join these channels. When you start on a  project, one of your team members will add you to the appropriate channel. 
* **social-: ** Casual, get-to-know-you channels for sharing on various topics. 
* **proposal- or prop-: ** Planned, temporary channels for putting together a biz dev proposal. If we win the bid, we rename the channel with a 'proj-' prefix.
* **hiring-:** Hiring (but you probably guessed that). Each role we post has a corresponding Slack channel for discussion. We archive it after the position is filled.
    * **Note:** There is a general #bloom-hiring channel for logistics and hiring ideas, but individual candidates are not discussed here.

If you want to create a new channel, reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for help.

**Other internal tools**

* **Calendly **is one of the systems we use to schedule meetings outside of Bloom.
    * Google Calendar also has an appointment booking feature, but it does have limitations. Do what works best for you and your project.
* **Greenhouse** is the system we use for hiring. Weâ€™ll add you if youâ€™re involved in the interview process. We didnâ€™t choose Greenhouse because itâ€™s a place where flowers can Bloom, but itâ€™s a lovely metaphor so letâ€™s pretend we did.
* **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸Gusto (U.S. salaried employees only)** is the system we use to onboard U.S.-based Bloomers and process payroll. Itâ€™s also where youâ€™ll request paid time off and sick leave.
* **Harvest** is the platform we use for 

<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "time tracking"). Did you generate a TOC with blue links? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[time tracking](#heading=h.ag9h3qi61tq6). This is also where youâ€™ll log [expenses (like travel and reimbursements](#expenses-and-reimbursement-procedures-28).
* **ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦Remote.com (Canadian employees only)**  is the Gusto of the North. 
    * **_Why do we use two different tools for the same function?_** At this time, Gusto doesnâ€™t support employees living internationally. At this time, neither platform supports those living in U.S. territories (Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands).
* **Zoom** is what we use for partner calls, unless clients prefer Microsoft Teams or Google Meet. Most Bloomers have free account access by default, which limits meetings to 40 minutes. If you think your meeting will run longer, you can either use Google Meet or reach out to your engagement manager to ask if a paid Zoom license is available.

## Project tools

Each project uses different tools, depending on what the work calls for, what the team agrees on, and what the client can access. Here are some of the tools we use most frequently:

* **Airtable** is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. Our Business Development and People Ops teams use this tool a lot, and some research teams use it to organize research ops.
* **Asana** is a project management tool to track work and manage tasks. If your project team uses Asana, contact [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for an account.
* **GitHub **is a tool we use to store code repositories, document projects with heavy change management (like this handbook!), and  manage project tasks. See[ Bloom's GitHub Org](https://github.com/bloom-works).
* **Mural** is what we use to whiteboard, collaborate, and facilitate  projects. We have a [shared Bloom account](https://app.mural.co/t/bloom5049) ðŸ”’ with limited licenses. If you need facilitator access, reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital).
* **Trello** is a project management tool some teams use. We also use it to host our Bloom [team profiles](https://trello.com/b/WVHYQUIn/bloom-overview).

If your project needs a different tool, reach out to your engagement manager. They can help you get access or find an alternative.
