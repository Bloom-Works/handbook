## Personal travel and temporary relocations

If you are planning to work from a location other than your home (like another state or country), talk to your manager before booking travel. In many cases, working from another state for a few days is no big deal, and weâ€™ll say so. But in some instances â€” including longer-term stays in some states â€” working from an unexpected location can create legal, tax, security, or contractual risks for you or Bloom.


## Working from another country

If you plan to work from a country outside the U.S., request approval from your people manager before you book your travel. Some of our contracts require everyone to be within the contiguous U.S.; even in cases where the contract doesnâ€™t prohibit international work, having team members traveling internationally can require adjustment for their teammates and clients. It may take 1-2 weeks for us to make a determination â€” plan accordingly.

Establishing residency in another country can also incur tax obligations and legal implications for you and Bloom, which will be part of our conversation if youâ€™re hoping to work internationally for more than a few weeks.

Hereâ€™s what you need to do before committing to following the Beyonce world tour life:


1. See if your project allows for working outside of the United States  (in general, none of our projects with the U.S. federal government permit work to be performed outside of the U.S.).
2. Discuss your plans with your people manager and create a plan that will make working sustainable for you, your team, and your client while you are abroad.
    1. Your people manager will reach out to your engagement manager to discuss.
3. Check in with People Ops to make them aware of your situation.


## Moving (U.S. and beyond)

If youâ€™re moving **within the same state or province**, tell People Ops and make sure to update your address in Gusto or Remote.

For moves** to a new state or province**, mention your plans to your manager as soon as youâ€™re considering relocating. Some cross-state moves can have legal or operational impacts for Bloom, which your manager will work with People Ops to understand and address. If we arenâ€™t able to operate in the area youâ€™re hoping to move to, weâ€™ll work with you to discuss options.

Bloom is currently **not able to support employees in U.S. territories, countries other than the U.S. or Canada, or Hawaii or Alaska**.


## Using a personal vehicle for local or long-distance work travel

If your job requires you to operate a personal vehicle for Bloom's business, Bloom needs proof of a current and valid state driver's license and proof of insurance.

If you are involved in an automobile accident while on Bloom's business, report the accident to your manager immediately. Request a police report and obtain anything available to you at the scene of the accident.
