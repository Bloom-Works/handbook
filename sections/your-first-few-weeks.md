title: Your first few weeks at Bloom
---

We want you to be supported from day one, so let's get you set up for success. Use the information here to learn about our systems, work culture, and norms.

## Computer and equipment

Bloom is a bring-your-own-device workplace. You're responsible for getting any equipment that will help you complete your work and participate fully in our remote work environment (like a webcam, microphone, or even lighting). 

Some projects issue government furnished equipment (GFE), but you’ll still need your own device for Bloom-related work.

We use collaboration tools that are compatible with all devices so you can keep working with whatever system suits you best. 

Remember,  we provide a [remote work stipend for all salaried Bloom folks](/sections/pay-and-benefits/#remote-work-stipend), so get what you need! 

If you want or have equipment recommendations, [Bloomers are populating this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pf4L1FK83dumIw3u9i-YEhmYBuAoM-TOFsDcYMuUl6E/edit) to help you out.

### Operatiing Systems
For security reasons, make sure your device's operating system is the latest version the manufacturer supports. We’ll occasionally check whether your device's OS version, password, and encryption settings are up-to-date when you log into Bloom's Google Workspace. Don’t worry, we won’t peek at your personal data. If we spot anything that needs an update, we’ll let you know.

Wondering if you’re up-to-date? Check the latest operating system versions here:

* For Mac: https://endoflife.date/macos

* For PC: https://endoflife.date/windows

If your device does not support the latest operating system, we recommend you use your remote work stipend to get a more current device.

## Tools to know

We try to use tools that work with any operating system. This gives Bloomers the ability to use Mac, Windows, Linux, or whatever OS your little heart desires. 

If you need support on any of these tools, pop into the **#bloom-tech-ops** channel in Slack and ask questions there.

### Bloom-wide tools

#### Google Workspace

We’ll issue you a Google-based @bloomworks.digital email address, which serves as your entry point to all the other tools. This is the main address you’ll use to communicate with folks outside of Bloom, and for more formal Bloom messages. 

You'll need to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) on your Bloom Google account. You can choose from several methods. We suggest using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or 1Password. If you prefer, you can use a security key—a small USB device that you touch to confirm your login. SMS is the least secure option, and we don’t recommend it.

We also use Google Calendar, Google Meet (as an alternative to Zoom), and Google Groups (for managing permissions and comms). You’ll also get a @govbloom.com email address because not all systems recognize .digital domains.

We currently have two shared Google calendars that are available for all Bloomers:

* [Bloom Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Z292Ymxvb20uY29tX2FubzYxYXZpbGx2bDI3NjdpMHZmamg5Y2NnQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20) 🔒 is where we document Out of Office time, operations deadlines of importance, and general info that needs to be shared with the whole team.
* [Bloom Business Development Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19rYWtmOWM0aXVqa3UxcWZwdTdzdTJtaWNhc0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) 🔒 is where we track proposal timelines, BD-related events, etc.

#### Chrome browser
We encourage you to use Google Chrome for Bloom work. Set up a separate Chrome profile tied to your Bloom Google Workspace account in order to keep your work and personal activities distinct. That way, your personal browsing stays private and isn’t impacted by our security measures at work.
Setting up a separate profile is easy and ensures that both your work and play can happen smoothly—without getting in each other's way!

#### Slack

We use Slack as a virtual office space to connect with coworkers. Feel free to say 'hi' or otherwise ping people there, just as you would if they were sitting at the desk next to you.

Our rule of thumb: when in doubt, over-communicate.

Our central Slack workspace is **govbloomdigital.slack.com**. For an introduction to using Slack, [check out Slack's guide to getting started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members) 🔒.

For some projects, we may join teams on separate Slack workspaces. We’ll grant you access to those on a project-by-project basis. Keep in mind that some Slack channels and workspaces may include our partners and clients.

We follow a pretty simple channel naming convention. If the channel starts with:  

* **bloom-:** Strictly internal and work related.  
* **comm-:** Committee chats. These are groups focused on a specific topic to build Bloom culture.
* **proj-:**  Current projects so team members can easily interact. IC's or other business partners sometimes join these channels. When you start on a  project, one of your team members will add you to the appropriate channel. 
* **social-:** Casual, get-to-know-you channels for sharing on various topics. 
* **proposal- or prop-:** Planned, temporary channels for putting together a biz dev proposal. If we win the bid, we rename the channel with a 'proj-' prefix.
* **hiring-:** Hiring (but you probably guessed that). Each role we post has a corresponding Slack channel for discussion. We archive it after the position is filled.
    * **Note:** There is a general #bloom-hiring channel for logistics and hiring ideas, but individual candidates are not discussed here.

If you want to create a new channel, reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for help.

#### Other internal tools

* **Calendly** is one of the systems we use to schedule meetings outside of Bloom.
    * Google Calendar also has an appointment booking feature, but it does have limitations. Do what works best for you and your project.
* **Greenhouse** is the system we use for hiring. We’ll add you if you’re involved in the interview process. We didn’t choose Greenhouse because it’s a place where flowers can Bloom, but it’s a lovely metaphor so let’s pretend we did.
* **🇺🇸 Gusto (U.S. salaried employees only)** is the system we use to onboard U.S.-based Bloomers and process payroll. It’s also where you’ll request paid time off and sick leave.
* **Harvest** is the platform we use for [time tracking](/sections/time-tracking/). This is also where you’ll log [expenses (like travel and reimbursements)](/sections/expenses-and-reimbursement/).
* **🇨🇦 Remote.com (Canadian employees only)**  is the Gusto of the North. 
    * **_Why do we use two different tools for the same function?_** At this time, Gusto doesn’t support employees living internationally and neither platform supports those living in U.S. territories.
* **Zoom** is what we use for partner calls, unless clients prefer Microsoft Teams or Google Meet. Most Bloomers have free account access by default, which limits meetings to 40 minutes. If you think your meeting will run longer, you can either use Google Meet or reach out to your engagement manager to ask if a paid Zoom license is available.

### Project tools

Each project uses different tools, depending on what the work calls for, what the team agrees on, and what the client can access. Here are some of the tools we use most frequently:

* **Airtable** is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. Our Business Development and People Ops teams use this tool a lot, and some research teams use it to organize research ops.
* **Asana** is a project management tool to track work and manage tasks. If your project team uses Asana, contact [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital) for an account.
* **GitHub** is a tool we use to store code repositories, document projects with heavy change management (like this handbook!), and  manage project tasks. See[ Bloom's GitHub Org](https://github.com/bloom-works).
* **Mural** is what we use to whiteboard, collaborate, and facilitate  projects. We have a [shared Bloom account](https://app.mural.co/t/bloom5049) 🔒 with limited licenses. If you need facilitator access, reach out to [People Ops](mailto:blossom@bloomworks.digital).
* **Trello** is a project management tool some teams use. We also use it to host our Bloom [team profiles](https://trello.com/b/WVHYQUIn/bloom-overview).

If your project needs a different tool, reach out to your engagement manager. They can help you get access or find an alternative.

## Meetings: What to expect

### Internal Bloom meetings

During your first few weeks, you’ll start to see meetings appear on your calendar. Here are some of the internal Bloom meetings you can expect:

* **Bloomtime:** These are regular meetings where we share operational updates, Q&As, or training. Attendance is optional unless indicated otherwise.
* **Project share outs:** These are hosted every couple of weeks as an opportunity for team members to share project updates, celebrate the close of a project, talk about new developments in our practice areas, and a wide range of other topics. Attendance is optional.
* **1:1s:** When you first join the team, your manager will set up check-ins on a weekly basis. As you settle in, these meetings may drop in frequency.
* **Quarterly All Hands:** Leadership will provide detailed information on the health, status and growth of Bloom. This meeting is mandatory.
* **Coffee/Tea Chats:** These are informal meetings we encourage you to have to get to know your coworkers better! They can be one-offs or regular.

All Bloom-wide meetings occur during our core hours (12 pm - 4:30 pm ET), and most are on Thursdays between 3-4 ET/12-1 PT. If anyone schedules a meeting outside your working hours, let them know — it’s usually a mistake, because time zones are hard.

### Project meetings

Once you’re assigned to a project, you’ll also settle into a cadence of check-ins, planning meetings, and client meetings. Every project has a different rhythm, so your manager can tell you more about what to expect.

### Offsites

As a distributed team, we make sure to get together in “real life” at least once a year! We hold our annual Bloom Offsite in the late summer or early fall for a chance to meet as a team, hold some workshops, and have some social time together. 

Occasionally, teams also have smaller offsites to collaborate or get to know each other.
